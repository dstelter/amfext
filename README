
amfext (native) 0.8.*
=====================

This extension implements the ActionScript Message Format 
for encoding and decoding,both in AMF and AMF3 versions.
Information can be found in [0].

This extension provides two low level functions useful for
encoding and decoding objects into AMF format, but it does
not provide functions for managing the full message. An
example of implementation can be found in [1].

Details on the encoding process can be read in doc/encoding.txt

Documentation on the PHP function and the callbacks is in doc/amfextdoc.php

Constants for the flags that can be used in the encoding/decoding are in amfext.php
that can be included.

The directory tests contains some tests that can be invoked directly. Eventually drop AMFPHP
sources somewhere for testing the PHP version against the C version. See test_common.php for
details.

Building
-------------

Under Windows: download the source of your PHP version and unpack the zip under the
ext directory of the source. Open the associated Visual Studio project (amf4.dsp or amf5.dsp)
and just build. Everything should be fine. For distributing the extension is suggested to use 
Visual Studio 6, otherwise 2003 is fine.

Under Uni*/Linux: obtain your php-devel package and unpack the zip in a directory. Then
as any PHP extension perform:

    phpize
    ./configure --enable-amf
    make install
    
Note: there could be some little problems if php includes are not under /usr

In any case remember to add the amf.so/php_amf.dll extension to the php.ini file

Known Builds
--------------

This code has been tested under Windows (PHP 4.4.0, 5.2.0) and Fedora (PHP 4.1.6) under a 32 bit machine.

Please check the behaviour with 64-bit machine

Thanks

Thanks to Patrick Mineault from AMF for the support, and from the authors
of the JSON PHP extension for the skeleton of the project.
